# CDMI Server


**INDIGO-DataCloud CDMI Server with QoS:**
* This project provides the official reference implementation of the **SNIA Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI)**, an ISO standard, and also a Spring Boot application port of the SNIA CDMI-Server.
* The **CDMI server** has been extended to support Quality-of-Service (QoS) and Data Life-cycle (DLC) operations for multiple storage back-ends like dCache, Ceph, GPFS, Gemss+TSM, StoRM and HPSS.
* the service offers improved QoS capabilities of storage resources.
  * a better support of high-level storage requirements such as flexible allocation of disk or tape storage space and support for data life cycle. This is an enhancement also with respect to what is currently available in public clouds, such as Amazon Glacier and Google Cloud Storage.
