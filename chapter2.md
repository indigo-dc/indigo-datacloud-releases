# INDIGO-2 ElectricIndigo

The [INDIGO-DataCloud](https://www.indigo-datacloud.eu/) is delighted to announce ElectricIndigo, the second and final major release of the project,. ElectricIndigo will be presented and demonstrated through several use cases at the [INDIGO Summit 2017, 9-12/5/2017](https://www.indigo-datacloud.eu/news/indigo-summit-2017-9-12-may-2017-catania-italy).
 
**ElectricIndigo** builds and expands on the first version of the software generated  by the project, called MidnightBlue, In this respect, it enhances  **stability**, adding more **programmability, scalability, automation and flexible network management**, to help resource providers and scientific communities address challenging problems and deliver new services.

## Installation Notes 

All INDIGO - DataCloud products are distributed from standard OS repositories and DockerHub registry. 

The packages repositories have the following structure:
* INDIGO-DC **production** (stable): ```indigo/2/<platform>/<basearch>/{base|updates}```
  * stable and signed, well tested software components, recommended to be installed on production-sites
* Third-party: ```indigo/2/<platform>/<basearch>/third-party```
  * packages that are not part of INDIGO, or not part of the base OS or EPEL, but used as dependencies by other INDIGO components
* INDIGO-DC **testing**: ```indigo-testing/2/<platform>/<basearch>```
  * packages that will become part of the next stable distribution; in the certification and validation phase.
* INDIGO-DC **preview**: ```indigo-preview/2/<platform>/<basearch>```
  * signed packages that will become part of the next stable update, available for technical-previews

where
* ```<basearch>``` is currently: x86_64, SRPMS, tgz 
* ```<platform>``` is currently: centos7, ubuntu

All packages are signed with the INDIGO - DataCloud gpg key. The public key can be downloaded from [here](http://repo.indigo-datacloud.eu/repository/RPM-GPG-KEY-indigodc), and the fingerprint from [here](http://repo.indigo-datacloud.eu/repository/INDIGODC_key_fingerprint.asc).

It is strongly recommended the use of the lastest version of the **indigodc-release** package containing the public key and the YUM and APT repository files.

On the [DockerHub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/), INDIGO - DataCloud has organized the repositories under two Organizations:
* [indigodatacloud](https://hub.docker.com/u/indigodatacloud/), for Core Services
* [indigodatacloudapps](https://hub.docker.com/u/indigodatacloudapps/), for Applications
Containers present in those repositories and released in INDIGO-2 are tagged with "*indigo-2*" tag and signed, leveraging the [Dockerâ€™s trust features](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/) so that users can pull trusted images.

To understand how to install and configure INDIGO-1 products either refer to the [Generic Installation & Configuration Guide](generic_installation_and_configuration_guide_1.md) chapter or to each individual product documentation.


## Software

INDIGO-2 software can be downloaded from [INDIGO DataCloud repositories](http://repo.indigo-datacloud.eu/).

## Support

Most complex software contains bugs, we are not an exception. One of the features of free and open source software is the ability to report bugs, helping to fix or improve the software you use.

INDIGO - DataCloud project uses the [GGUS (Global Grid User Support)](https://ggus.eu/) tool as its user support system. It provides sophisticated search functionality, report generation, interfaces to bug tracking systems used by different middleware components, and automatic ticket reminder including escalation indication.
Please use the **INDIGO - DataCloud Catch-All** GGUS Support Unit or directly  contact us through the [indigo-su@lists.indigo-datacloud.eu](https://lists.indigo-datacloud.eu/sympa/info/indigo-su) mailing-list.

More details regarding  each product support channels are provided in the respective products release pages.
