# Infrastructure Manager 

The **Infrastructure Manager (IM)** is a tool that deploys complex and customized virtual infrastructures on IaaS Cloud deployments (such as AWS, OpenStack, etc.). 
* It eases the access and the usability of IaaS clouds by automating the VMI (Virtual Machine Image) selection, deployment, configuration, software installation, monitoring and update of the virtual infrastructure. 
* It supports APIs from a large number of virtual platforms, making user applications cloud-agnostic. 
* In addition it integrates a contextualization system to enable the installation and configuration of all the user required applications providing the user with a fully functional infrastructure.

This version evolved in the [INDIGO-Datacloud project](https://www.indigo-datacloud.eu/) by adding support to TOSCA documents as input for the infrastructure creation.
