# Data Solutions

The INDIGO - DataCloud project  provides a complete set of data-related features that includes: 
* *Distributed Data Federation* through several protocols, in order to support both legacy application and advanced standard interfaces such as CDMI or just simple web interfaces.
* *The possibility to federate diverse storage technologies* (such as Posix, Object Storage, CEPH, etc) in a seamless way, letting users exploit data and storage resources wherever they are available.
