# Automated Solutions

The INDIGO - DataCloud project provides a rich set of high-level automated functionalities. Some of the most innovative are: 
* Improved capabilities in the *geographical exploitation of Cloud resources*. End users need not know where resources are located, because the INDIGO PaaS layer hides the complexity of both scheduling and brokering.
* *Standard interface to access PaaS services*. INDIGO uses the TOSCA standard to hide the difference on the different way of implementing services at the PaaS level.
* Support for *data requirements in Cloud resource allocations*: computational resources can be requested and allocated where data is stored.
* Integrated use of resources coming from *both public and private Cloud* infrastructures.
* Deployment, monitoring and *automatic scalability of existing applications*.
* Integrated support for *high-performance Big Data analytics*.
* Support for *dynamic and elastic clusters of resources*. HTCondor, Torque and Mesos cluster are supported.
